She was an American Girl
built on promises
she couldn't help thinking that there
was a little more to life
somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin'
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

oh yeah 
all right 
take it easy baby
make it last all night

she was
an american girl
